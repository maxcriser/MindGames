      "task": "A man went into a restaurant and ordered himself a portion of the meat of the albatross. \nAfter that he went out and shot himself. \nThe question: why did he shoot himself?",
      "answer": "Once upon a time, a man and his wife traveled the seas and the ship was shipwrecked. He and his wife and one sailor miraculously reached the uninhabited island. The wife of this man was seriously injured. On the island was the problem of hunger. One day, after returning from hunting, the sailor treated him with albatross meat, and about his wife said that she died and he buried her. After some time, they were rescued.\nIn the restaurant, having tried the real meat of the albatross, he realized that at that time he ate his wife."
